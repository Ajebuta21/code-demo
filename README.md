# SwarmaKit Vue Demo

## Description
This is a demo project for integrating the `@swarmakit/vue` library in a Vue 3 + Vite setup. Due to an issue with resolving the package's entry file, I created a placeholder implementation to demonstrate my understanding of Vue and problem-solving skills.

## Encountered Issue
- Error: `Failed to resolve entry for package "@swarmakit/vue".`
- Cause: Likely related to the package's `package.json` or export configuration.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Reinstalled the library using `npm install @swarmakit/vue`.
2. Verified package contents in `node_modules`.
3. Tried alternative import paths and Vite alias configurations.

## Placeholder Implementation
While the issue persists, I implemented a custom button component to simulate functionality. The demo includes:
- A clickable button that updates the UI.
- Comments indicating the intended integration of the SwarmaKit library.


## Next Steps
- Collaborate with the Swarmauri team to resolve the library's compatibility issues.
- Gain deeper familiarity with `@swarmakit/vue`.
